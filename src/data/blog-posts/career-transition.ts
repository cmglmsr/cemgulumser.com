The transition from being a computer science student to a working security engineer has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences of my professional journey. Looking back, I want to share the lessons I've learned and provide guidance for those considering a similar path.

## The Academic Foundation

My journey began at Bilkent University, where I pursued a BSc in Computer Science. The theoretical foundation I gained there proved invaluable, but I quickly realized that academic knowledge alone wasn't sufficient for real-world security challenges.

**Key Academic Skills That Transferred:**
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Understanding complex systems and their vulnerabilities
- **Programming Proficiency**: Ability to write secure code and analyze malicious code
- **Problem-Solving**: Systematic approach to debugging and incident response
- **Research Skills**: Staying updated with the latest security threats and solutions

## Early Professional Experience

### The SunExpress Internship

My first taste of professional cybersecurity came during my internship at SunExpress Airlines. This experience was crucial in bridging the gap between academic knowledge and practical application.

**What I Learned:**
- **Network Security**: Hands-on experience with firewalls, intrusion detection systems
- **Penetration Testing**: Using tools like BurpSuite for web application security testing
- **Cloud Security**: Working with Microsoft Azure and understanding cloud security models
- **Incident Response**: Real-world experience with security incidents and their resolution

### Teaching CS115 at Bilkent

Serving as a CS115 tutor taught me the importance of clear communication and patience—skills that are essential in security engineering when explaining complex vulnerabilities to non-technical stakeholders.

## Joining TR7 Cyber Security

My role as a Security Software Engineer at TR7 Cyber Security was where I truly began to understand the depth and breadth of cybersecurity work.

### Key Projects and Learnings

**TR7 ASP Development:**
- Built comprehensive security platform with WAF, load balancing, and IAM
- Gained experience with full-stack development (Python, JavaScript, Vue.js)
- Learned about microservices architecture and containerization
- Implemented compliance frameworks (EAL4+, ISO 27001)

**Technical Skills Developed:**
- **Kernel-Level Programming**: Developed networking components at the kernel level
- **Distributed Systems**: Worked with Redis for distributed caching
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker and Kubernetes for microservices management
- **Cloud Platforms**: Extensive AWS experience

## Current Role at Garanti BBVA

As a Senior Security Engineer at one of Europe's largest banks, I've gained exposure to enterprise-scale security challenges.

**Current Responsibilities:**
- **Cloud Security**: Managing security posture across hybrid cloud environments
- **Container Security**: Securing OpenShift deployments
- **Compliance**: Ensuring adherence to banking regulations and security standards
- **Threat Detection**: Implementing and maintaining security monitoring systems

## Lessons Learned Along the Way

### 1. Continuous Learning is Essential

The cybersecurity landscape evolves rapidly. What was considered secure yesterday might be vulnerable today. I've learned to:

- Stay updated with security news and research
- Participate in security communities and conferences
- Pursue continuous education (like my current MSc at Oxford)
- Practice with platforms like HackTheBox and TryHackMe

### 2. Soft Skills Matter

Technical skills are crucial, but soft skills are equally important:

- **Communication**: Explaining security risks to business stakeholders
- **Collaboration**: Working with development teams to implement secure coding practices
- **Problem-Solving**: Thinking creatively to solve complex security challenges
- **Mentoring**: Helping junior team members grow their skills

### 3. Build a Diverse Skill Set

Cybersecurity is a broad field. I've found value in developing skills across multiple areas:

- **Programming**: Multiple languages and frameworks
- **Networking**: Understanding network protocols and security
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, and hybrid environments
- **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements and frameworks
- **Research**: Academic research and staying current with threats

## Advice for Aspiring Security Engineers

### 1. Start with Fundamentals

- **Programming**: Learn at least one language well (Python, JavaScript, or Go)
- **Networking**: Understand TCP/IP, HTTP, and common protocols
- **Operating Systems**: Linux and Windows security fundamentals
- **Web Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and common frameworks

### 2. Gain Practical Experience

- **Lab Environments**: Set up your own security lab using VMs
- **Capture The Flag (CTF)**: Participate in CTF competitions
- **Open Source**: Contribute to security projects
- **Internships**: Seek opportunities in security-related roles

### 3. Build a Professional Network

- **LinkedIn**: Connect with security professionals
- **Conferences**: Attend security conferences and meetups
- **Online Communities**: Join security forums and Discord servers
- **Mentorship**: Find mentors in the field

### 4. Stay Current

- **Security News**: Follow security blogs and news sites
- **Research Papers**: Read academic and industry research
- **Certifications**: Consider relevant certifications (CISSP, CEH, etc.)
- **Continuous Education**: Pursue advanced degrees or specialized training

## The Future of Cybersecurity

Looking ahead, I see several trends that will shape the cybersecurity landscape:

- **AI and Machine Learning**: Both for defense and offense
- **Cloud Security**: Continued focus on securing cloud environments
- **IoT Security**: Protecting the growing number of connected devices
- **Zero Trust**: Moving beyond perimeter-based security models
- **Quantum Computing**: Preparing for post-quantum cryptography

## Conclusion

The transition from student to security engineer is challenging but incredibly rewarding. The key is to approach it as a continuous learning journey, combining theoretical knowledge with practical experience.

For those considering this path, remember that cybersecurity is not just about technical skills—it's about protecting people, organizations, and society from digital threats. This sense of purpose makes the challenges worthwhile.
