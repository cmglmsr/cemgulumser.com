I'm excited to introduce **RouterGuard** (published as RT Guard on npm), an open-source security middleware for Express.js applications that I developed to help fellow developers secure their APIs more effectively.

## The Problem

During my time developing security solutions at TR7 Cyber Security and working with various web applications, I noticed a common pattern: many developers either skip implementing basic security measures or implement them inconsistently across different routes.

Common issues I observed:
- Inconsistent input validation
- Missing rate limiting
- Inadequate request filtering
- Poor error handling that leaks sensitive information

## The Solution: RouterGuard

RouterGuard is designed to be a comprehensive, easy-to-use middleware that provides multiple layers of security for Express.js applications.

### Key Features

üîí **Request Filtering**: Automatically filter potentially malicious requests
üìä **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting with customizable rules
üõ°Ô∏è **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
üìù **Audit Logging**: Detailed logging of security events
‚ö° **Performance Optimized**: Minimal overhead on application performance

### Installation

\`\`\`bash
npm install rtguard
\`\`\`

### Basic Usage

\`\`\`javascript
const express = require('express');
const rtguard = require('rtguard');

const app = express();

// Apply RouterGuard to all routes
app.use(rtguard({
  level: 'strict',
  allowedMethods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
  allowedContentTypes: ['application/json', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'],
  rateLimit: {
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  }
}));

// Your routes
app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ users: [] });
});
\`\`\`

### Advanced Configuration

\`\`\`javascript
const rtguard = require('rtguard');

app.use(rtguard({
  level: 'custom',
  customPatterns: [
    /<script[^>]*>.*?<\/script>/gi, // XSS patterns
    /union.*select/gi, // SQL injection patterns
    /\.\.\//g // Path traversal patterns
  ],
  whitelist: ['/api/public/*'],
  blacklist: ['/api/admin/*'],
  logging: {
    enabled: true,
    level: 'info',
    format: 'json'
  },
  rateLimit: {
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
    max: 100,
    skipSuccessfulRequests: true
  }
}));
\`\`\`

## Security Patterns Detected

RouterGuard automatically detects and blocks common attack patterns:

- **XSS Attempts**: Script injection, event handler injection
- **SQL Injection**: Union-based, error-based, time-based attacks
- **Path Traversal**: Directory traversal attempts
- **Command Injection**: System command injection patterns
- **NoSQL Injection**: MongoDB, CouchDB injection patterns

## Performance Impact

One of my key goals was to ensure RouterGuard doesn't significantly impact application performance. Benchmarks show:

- **Overhead**: < 2ms per request (average)
- **Memory Usage**: < 5MB additional memory
- **CPU Impact**: Minimal CPU usage increase

## Real-World Usage

Since publishing RouterGuard, it has been downloaded over 1,000 times and is being used in production applications. Here's what users are saying:

> "RouterGuard saved us from multiple potential security incidents. The easy configuration and comprehensive protection make it a must-have for any Express.js application." - *Senior Developer at a FinTech startup*

## Contributing to Open Source

Developing RouterGuard has reinforced my belief in the power of open-source software. By making security tools accessible and easy to use, we can collectively improve the security posture of web applications.

### How to Contribute

I welcome contributions from the community:

1. **Bug Reports**: Found an issue? Please report it on GitHub
2. **Feature Requests**: Have ideas for improvements? Open an issue
3. **Code Contributions**: Submit pull requests for bug fixes or new features
4. **Documentation**: Help improve the documentation

## Future Roadmap

I have several exciting features planned for RouterGuard:

- **Machine Learning Integration**: AI-powered threat detection
- **GraphQL Support**: Extend protection to GraphQL APIs
- **Dashboard**: Web-based monitoring and configuration interface
- **Plugin System**: Allow custom security modules

## Lessons Learned

Building RouterGuard taught me several valuable lessons:

1. **Security is Everyone's Responsibility**: Making security tools accessible helps the entire community
2. **Documentation is Key**: Good documentation is as important as good code
3. **Community Feedback is Invaluable**: User feedback drives meaningful improvements
4. **Performance Matters**: Security tools must not compromise application performance
